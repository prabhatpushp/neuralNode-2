# NeuralNode 2

## Introduction
NeuralNode 2 is an enhanced version of the NeuralNode project, providing a more flexible and powerful neural network implementation. It is designed to solve the XOR problem and can be easily extended for other tasks.

## Features
- **Neural Network Structure**: Implements a more advanced neural network with multiple hidden nodes.
- **Activation Functions**: Utilizes the Sigmoid activation function for node computations.
- **Training Functionality**: Includes a training loop to train the network on XOR data.
- **Error Tracking**: Monitors and prints the loss during training iterations.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: The programming language used for development.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and matrix manipulations.

## Usage
1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python neural_node.py
   ```
2. The script will train the neural network on XOR data and print the results.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prabhatpushp/neuralNode-2
   cd NeuralNode 2
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Development
